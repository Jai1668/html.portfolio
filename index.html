    <hr />
    <p>Hello every one, thanks for visiting my portfolio. Currently there is no styling and effects on my web page.
       But soon I will  be making a better page. You can know more about me by clicking on this hyperlink - <a href="./public/about.html">About me</a> 
    </p>
    <p>There is nothing much to know about me (atleast for now). But if you ever feel like reaching out or just want to connect, you can message me on Instagram.
         I’m currently not on LinkedIn, but I’ll be adding my LinkedIn profile here once I create one. Feel free to drop a message anytime!</p>
    <p> <a href="./public/contact.html">contact me</a></p>
